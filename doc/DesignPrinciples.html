<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Design Choices in the Blackjack
Package</h1>



<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>Blackjack</strong> package was designed to be a clean,
extensible, and robust simulation of the game of Blackjack for R users.
This vignette documents key architectural and design decisions,
including function structure, argument choices, workflow, modularity,
and use of R’s object-oriented features.</p>
</div>
<div id="internal-modular-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Internal Modular Functions</h2>
<div id="function-names-and-arguments" class="section level3">
<h3>Function Names and Arguments</h3>
<p>The function names are chosen to be descriptive and follow common
naming conventions, making them easy to understand for users with
different levels of experience in programming. Each function name
reflects the operation it performs in a straightforward manner.</p>
<p>The arguments for the functions are designed to be intuitive,
minimizing the need for extensive documentation. The names of the
arguments are chosen to be as self-explanatory as possible: -
num_players and num_decks in <code>play_blackjack()</code> are used to
define the number of players and decks, respectively. These arguments
are crucial for customizing the game based on the user’s
preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>dealer_hand and player_hands in <code>dealer_play()</code> and
<code>deal_cards()</code> represent the hands of the dealer and the
players, ensuring clarity when referencing the cards being
dealt.</p></li>
<li><p>player_accepts in <code>insurance_bet()</code> makes it clear
whether the player has accepted the insurance bet, reflecting the
player’s choice.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="usage-of-non-standard-evaluation-and-c" class="section level3">
<h3>Usage of Non-standard evaluation and C++</h3>
<div id="non-standard-evaluation-nse" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Non-standard evaluation (NSE)</strong></h4>
<p>NSE is used to capture and evaluate user input dynamically (e.g.,
“Hit” or “Stand”), allowing for flexible game flow and extending the
package’s functionality. Modular functions, such as
<code>player_split()</code> and <code>dealer_play()</code>, ensure that
each game aspect is independent and easy to extend, making the codebase
adaptable to new rules or features.</p>
</div>
<div id="c-integration-for-performance-enhancement" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>C++ Integration for Performance Enhancement</strong></h4>
<p>The Blackjack package integrates C++ through the use of Rcpp to
efficiently handle card scoring. Specifically, the cpp_score_hand
function calculates the total score of a player’s hand, iterating over
the cards, mapping their ranks to values, and adjusting for Aces
(counting them as either 1 or 11). This integration allows the package
to offload computation-heavy tasks to C++, significantly improving the
performance, especially when dealing with multiple players or
simulations. By using a std::map to store card values and handling Aces
dynamically, the C++ code is optimized for speed, making the game flow
faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The C++ function is seamlessly exposed to R, allowing users to invoke
it directly through Rcpp’s export functionality. This integration
minimizes the overhead of R’s native loops, ensuring that the
hand-scoring operation is efficient even in computationally intense
scenarios. Additionally, the R interface ensures that errors, such as
invalid card ranks, are properly handled, providing a robust experience
for users. The C++ integration thus serves as a performance enhancement,
enabling the package to handle larger datasets or more rounds without
compromising on responsiveness. Future enhancements could include
additional optimizations or a deeper integration of C++ for other
aspects of the game.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="generic-functions" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Generic functions</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-purpose functions</strong>: Each exported function
has one clear job (dealing, scoring, splitting, insurance, etc.),
supporting easier testing and extension.</li>
<li><strong>Composability</strong>: Outputs are lists or atomic values,
so functions can be chained or combined.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit game workflow</strong>: The
<code>play_blackjack()</code> function orchestrates setup, player turns,
dealer play, and scoring, reflecting the real rules of Blackjack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each function is modular, with a clear and specific responsibility.
This structure allows easy testing, modification, and extension of the
package:</p>
<div id="object-oriented-design-s3vctrs" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Object-Oriented Design (S3/vctrs)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom vctrs class</strong>: Cards are represented by a
custom <code>card_vector</code> S3/vctrs class. This enables:
<ul>
<li>Type safety for all card-related operations</li>
<li>Attractive printing or font (e.g., <code>[A♠]</code>)</li>
<li>Integration with tidyverse/vctrs tools</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Supporting methods</strong>: Implemented
<code>format()</code>, <code>vec_ptype2()</code>, and
<code>vec_cast()</code> methods for compatibility and usability.</li>
<li><strong>Extractors</strong>: Generic-style functions
<code>card_rank()</code>, <code>card_suit()</code>,
<code>card_is_face()</code> for robust, reusable card information
extraction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Card Vector Functions</strong> (like card_vector, card_rank,
card_suit, card_is_face) handle the representation of cards and provide
methods to extract or check information about them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>card_vector()</code>: Creates a custom vector class
(card_vector) for representing a deck of cards as strings, such as “A♠”,
“10♣”, “K♥”. Usage: Takes a character vector and returns a card_vector
object.</p></li>
<li><p><code>card_rank()</code>: Extracts the rank (number or face
value) from each card in the card_vector (e.g., “A”, “10”, “Q”). Usage:
Returns a character vector with ranks extracted from the
card_vector.</p></li>
<li><p><code>card_suit()</code>: Extracts the suit (e.g., “♠”, “♣”, “♥”)
from each card in the card_vector. Usage: Returns a character vector
with suits extracted from the card_vector.</p></li>
<li><p><code>card_is_face()</code>: Checks if each card in the
card_vector is a face card (Jack, Queen, or King). Usage: Returns a
logical vector indicating whether the card is a face card (TRUE for face
cards, FALSE for others).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="game-flow-functions" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Game Flow Functions</strong></h4>
<p>These functions manage the overall game flow, starting the game,
dealing cards, and managing the player’s and dealer’s turns.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>create_board()</code>: Generates a shuffled deck of cards
with a specified number of decks and returns a shuffled deck as a
character vector of card strings (e.g., “A♠”, “10♣”, “K♥”).</p></li>
<li><p><code>deal_cards()</code>: Deals 2 cards to each player and 1
card to the dealer from a shuffled deck and returns a list containing
player_hands, dealer_hand, and the remaining deck.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dealer_play()</code>: Simulates the dealer’s turn, drawing
cards until the dealer’s hand reaches 17 or the dealer gets 5 cards
without busting, and returns the updated dealer’s hand and the remaining
deck.</p></li>
<li><p><code>player_split()</code>: Allows the player to split a pair of
cards into two separate hands and returns whether the player can split
the cards and the resulting split hands.</p></li>
<li><p><code>play_blackjack()</code>: Starts an interactive game of
Blackjack, prompting users for the number of players, decks, and actions
like hit, stand, surrender, and double down, and runs the game loop
managing player actions and dealer behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="betting-functions" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Betting Functions</strong></h4>
<p>These functions manage the player’s betting actions, such as doubling
down, taking insurance, or surrendering.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>insurance_bet()</code>: Offers the player the option to
take insurance if the dealer’s upcard is Ace. If accepted, it checks if
the dealer has Blackjack and calculates the payout, returning the result
of the insurance bet, including the payout and whether the insurance was
successful.</p></li>
<li><p><code>double_down()</code>: Allows a player to double their bet
by taking exactly one more card and returns the updated hand, the new
deck, and a validity flag (TRUE if double down is valid).</p></li>
<li><p><code>surrender_hand()</code>: Allows a player to surrender and
forfeit half their bet and returns a status (whether the player has
surrendered or not) and the associated message regarding the
surrender.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="scoring-functions" class="section level4">
<h4>Scoring Functions</h4>
<p>These functions calculate the score of the player’s hand and manage
the game’s rules for scoring.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>score_hand()</code>: Calculates the score of a hand,
adjusting for Aces (if score &gt; 21, Ace is treated as 1) and returns
the score of the hand, considering the Ace as 1 if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><code>announce_winner()</code>: Compares the player scores with
the dealer’s score and announces the outcome (Win, Lose, or Tie),
returning a vector of outcomes for each player.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="user-workflow" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>User Workflow</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive and scriptable</strong>: Users can either step
through the game interactively (<code>play_blackjack()</code>) or call
lower-level functions for custom simulations or analyses.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive programming</strong>: All functions check argument
types/lengths and handle edge cases (e.g., invalid hands, out-of-bounds
splits).</li>
<li><strong>Clear feedback</strong>: Results are printed in a readable,
game-like format (e.g., final hands, scores, win/lose messages).</li>
</ul>
<p>The game flow is designed to be interactive, with the user making
decisions at each stage. The play_blackjack function guides the user
through the game, prompting them to decide whether to surrender, split,
or double down. The use of the readline() function allows for this
interactive user experience. After each action, the game continues, and
the player’s hand is updated accordingly.</p>
<p>The workflow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initial Setup:The user is prompted to enter the number of players
and decks. The function validates the number of players and ensures a
valid number of decks are selected, defaulting based on the number of
players if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Deck Creation and Card Dealing: A shuffled deck is created using
the <code>create_board()</code> function, and the
<code>deal_cards()</code> function distributes 2 cards to each player
and 1 card to the dealer. The dealer’s first card is revealed, and the
remaining cards are made available for players’ actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance Option: If the dealer’s upcard is an Ace, players are
offered the option to take insurance. The outcome of the insurance bet
is evaluated, including the check for a Blackjack on the dealer’s part,
and the results are recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Player Actions: For each player, the game proceeds with a series
of interactive prompts:</p></li>
<li><p>Surrender: Players can opt to surrender, forfeiting half of their
bet.</p></li>
<li><p>Split: If a player has a pair, they can choose to split it into
two separate hands.</p></li>
<li><p>Double Down: Players with hands valued at 10 or 11 can choose to
double down by adding a single card to their hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Hit/Stand: Players may continue to hit (receive additional cards)
or stand (end their turn). The game ensures that invalid inputs are
handled appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p>Dealer’s Turn: After all players have finished their turns, the
dealer plays according to the Blackjack rules, drawing cards until
reaching a score of at least 17 or obtaining 5 cards without busting.
The dealer’s hand is revealed and the final score is
calculated.</p></li>
<li><p>Result Calculation: Once the dealer completes their turn, the
scores of the players are compared against the dealer’s score. Each
player’s outcome is determined: Win, Lose, or Tie based on their final
score relative to the dealer’s hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Round Summary and Replay: The results for each player are
displayed, and the game provides a summary of the final hands and
scores. Players are invited to start a new round or end the session,
with the option to adjust the number of decks or players for subsequent
rounds.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p><strong>Test Coverage:</strong> The current tests focus on core
mechanics but lack edge case handling (e.g., invalid inputs). Future
work should improve test coverage to handle more complex scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay Features:</strong> Advanced betting strategies
(e.g., card counting, progressive betting) and multi-round tracking are
not implemented. These features could be added for a richer
experience.</p>
<p><strong>UI/UX:</strong> The text-based interface works but isn’t
ideal for larger groups. A GUI using shiny or ggplot2 would improve user
experience.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer Functionality:</strong> Players are prompted
sequentially. Supporting asynchronous input for larger groups could
enhance gameplay.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternative-designs" class="section level2">
<h2>Alternative designs</h2>
<p><strong>Object-Oriented Design (OOP):</strong> An OOP approach was
considered but not implemented, as it would complicate the code
unnecessarily. A function-based design was chosen for simplicity and
flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive GUI:</strong> A GUI was considered but not
implemented due to time constraints. A text-based interface was used for
simplicity, though a GUI could be added in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Multiplayer:</strong> Real-time multiplayer via
WebSockets was considered but not implemented to keep the project
simpler. A sequential turn-based model was chosen for ease of use.</p>
<p><strong>Modular Betting Strategies:</strong> Complex betting
strategies (e.g., Martingale) were deferred to keep the game focused on
basic actions. They could be added later for advanced users.</p>
</div>
<div id="ai-vs.-human-contributions" class="section level2">
<h2>AI vs. human contributions</h2>
<p>The development of this package has been a collaborative effort
involving both human expertise and AI assistance.</p>
<div id="humane-contributions" class="section level3">
<h3>Humane contributions</h3>
<p>The development of this package was primarily driven by human
expertise in crafting the core game logic and functionality. The
developer designed and implemented the essential game functions,
including <code>play_blackjack()</code>, <code>dealer_play()</code>,
<code>double_down()</code>, and others that manage gameplay mechanics
such as card dealing, player actions, and the determination of game
outcomes. The developer also made critical design decisions, such as
using a function-based approach over object-oriented programming, which
allowed for clearer modularization and flexibility. Additionally, the
human contributions encompassed writing and refining the package’s
documentation, ensuring clear explanations of the functions, their
purposes, and usage examples. The testing was also handled by the
developer, who focused on edge cases and ensuring the integrity of the
game logic.</p>
</div>
<div id="ai-contributions" class="section level3">
<h3>AI contributions</h3>
<p>AI contributed significantly to the debugging and optimization phases
of this project. It assisted in identifying and resolving errors
encountered during test execution, particularly when running
<code>devtools::check()</code> and resolving issues with the package
loading process. Additionally, AI played a key role in optimizing the
efficiency of functions, particularly when dealing with large datasets
or complex operations such as scoring hands in the Blackjack game. By
suggesting more efficient code structures and practices, it helped
streamline the game’s logic and reduce redundant operations. Moreover,
AI provided valuable guidance on integrating C++ functions, particularly
in optimizing the score_hand_dynamic function. It assisted in resolving
issues with the C++ code compilation and helped re-factor the function
to handle card rank extraction and score calculation more efficiently,
improving performance in scenarios involving large hands or multiple
players. Through these contributions, AI helped enhance the
functionality, performance, and overall robustness of the package.</p>
